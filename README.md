Verilog Circuit Generator
This project provides a flexible Verilog circuit generator with the following features:

1-Circuit Type Detection: Automatically determines whether the circuit is sequential or combinational. If sequential, you can specify the clock and reset signals.
2-Parameterization: Allows you to decide whether to use parameters or vectors, define the number of parameters, and set their values.
3-Input Configuration: Customize the number of inputs, with options to parameterize them or not.
4-Output Configuration: Specify the number of outputs, their direction as reg or wire, and whether they are parameterized or not, including which parameters apply.
5-Internal Signals: Optionally include internal wires and registers, with control over their parameterization.
6-Sequential Circuit Options: For sequential circuits, specify whether they are synchronous or asynchronous.
7-Edge Sensitivity: Define which edge (rising or falling) the circuit will respond to for signal changes.
